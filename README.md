# 🏨 Hotel No-Show Prediction with MLOps

This project predicts the likelihood of a hotel reservation resulting in a no-show, using machine learning and end-to-end MLOps practices. It demonstrates how to take a model from development to production with proper tooling and automation.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal is to build a robust binary classification model that helps hotels reduce losses by anticipating no-shows and optimizing resource allocation. This includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Experiment tracking with MLflow
- CI/CD automation using Jenkins
- Model deployment

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- **MLflow** – for tracking experiments and managing model lifecycle
- **Jenkins** – to automate testing and deployment pipelines
- **GVP** – for deploying the trained model into a production-like environment
- **Git** – version control
- **Docker** – containerization
